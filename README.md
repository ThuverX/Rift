Rift is an easy to use (and experimental) component based dom renderer.
Rift has an easy to use component system. You just create components and Rift handles the rest. You can focus on programming your application instead of fighting with frameworks.

Rift works in plain Javascript and doesn't need any preprocessing to work, or be manageable. This is thanks to Rift's easy to use `r` (Shortcut) template strings!

# Usage

Creating components is easy in Rift. Just extend Component and register it!.
Any time you use the component inside another component Rift with automagically use the right component.
State isn't some annoying object or function. You just define your variables and anytime they are updated, the component updates.

```js
class ExampleComponent extends Component {

    isClicked = false

    onClick() {
        this.isClicked = !this.isClicked
    }

    render() {
        return r`
        <div>
            <a>This is a component!</a>
            <button onclick="${this.onClick.bind(this)}">${this.isClicked ? 'Clicked' : 'Not clicked'}</button>
        </div>`
    }
}
```

To start rendering your components call `Rift.root` passing in your dom root element and your main component.
